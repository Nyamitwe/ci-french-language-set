French system language set for CodeIgniter
==========================================

CodeIgniter is a PHP framework published by EllisLab.

This repository is one of my contributions to the framework. It contains all versions of the french language set since release 1.6.1.

Each release exists as tag (current CI convention) and as branch (more suitable 
for my workflow).

From time to time I synch CodeIgniter's develop branch with this master branch. As of now I do not use a develop branch on remote.
